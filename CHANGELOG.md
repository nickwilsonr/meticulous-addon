# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to this add-on are documented here.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-01-09

### ✨ Improvements
- **More sensors available immediately** - Profile author and last shot details (name, profile, rating, time) now appear as soon as the add-on starts
- **Better sensor coverage** - Added 5 new sensors that were missing from MQTT discovery
- **Smarter startup** - The add-on now fetches all available sensor data at startup instead of waiting for updates

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed sensors that would show "unknown" until the machine was actively used
- Corrected sensor discovery to match documented sensor list

### 📝 Note
- Some sensors (pressure, flow, temperatures) only update when the machine is actively brewing, as they're only available via real-time Socket.IO events
- Brightness sensor will show "unknown" until explicitly set (API limitation)
